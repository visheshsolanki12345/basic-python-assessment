================================ Start Q 1 ====================================
Q 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
    integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

Ans 1 => 
  string = 'hello'
  integer = 6
  negative float = -87.8
  mathematical operators = *, -, +, /
================================ End Q 1 =====================================


================================ Start Q 2 ====================================
Q 2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Ans 1 => 
    String :- 
        The string is a text or characters which we define inside double code in python.
    Variable :- 
        The variable is a value the value can be a string, integer, or float, and the variable value can be changed.
================================ End Q 2 =====================================


================================ Start Q 3 ====================================
Q 3. Describe three different data types.
Ans 3 => 
    1. String 
        String holds sequence of characters  like ("raj", "aman", "mumbai").
    2. Numeric
        Numeric holds numeric values like (1, 2, 5.5).
    3. Boolean
        Boolean holds True and False
================================ End Q 3 =====================================


================================ Start Q 4 ====================================
Q 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans 4 => 
    An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, or method,
    and all expressions do calls some operation or calculation.
================================ End Q 4 =====================================


================================ Start Q 5 ====================================
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
Ans 5 => 
    An expression is a variables or method, and statement like standalone, and it doesn't return anything.
================================ End Q 5 =====================================


================================ Start Q 6 ====================================
Q 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
Ans 6 =>
    bacon contain only 22 because we did not update bacon again we should have done before of bacon += then our result would be 23
================================ End Q 6 =====================================


================================ Start Q 7 ====================================
Q 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
Ans 7 =>
    'spam'+'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam' # 2 string has marged
    'spam'*3 = 'spamspamspam' # 3 times of spam 
================================ End Q 7 =====================================


================================ Start Q 8 ====================================
Q 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid ?
Ans 8 =>
    Because we can't pass as variable names in python like int, float, boolean
    that's why 100 giving an error.
================================ End Q 8 =====================================


================================ Start Q 9 ====================================
Q 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
Ans 9 =>
    Those 3 inbuilt functions names are.
    1. (int for get number) ex : int('10') = 10
    2. (str for get string)  ex : str(500) = '500'
    3. (float for get float number)  ex : float('200') = 200.0
================================ End Q 9 =====================================


================================ Start Q 9 ====================================
Q 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
Ans 9 =>
    because in this ('I have eaten'+99+'burritos.') expression having addition, addition can do with number to number or string to string or float to float but over here having mixup that's why expression getting an error.
================================ End Q 10 =====================================
