    "Ans. Inheritance is used to establish a hierarchical relationship between classes, where the derived class inherits and extends \n",
    "    the functionality of the base class. It promotes code reusability and modularity, \n",
    "    Inheritance enables you to reuse code from an existing class. By defining a base class with common attributes and behaviors, you can create derived classes that inherit those features. This avoids duplicating code and promotes a more efficient development process.\n",

    "    differences and advantages.\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "    Differences between Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "        1. Single inheritance creates a linear hierarchy of classes, whereas multiple inheritance leads to a more complex, potentially  diamond-shaped hierarchy.\n",
    "        2.  Single inheritance offers simplicity and a clear hierarchy, while multiple inheritance provides greater code reuse and flexibility. It's essential to carefully consider the design and trade-offs to determine which approach best fits the problem at hand.\n",
    "        3. Multiple inheritance can introduce naming conflicts when two or more superclasses have methods or attributes with the same name\n",
    "\n",
    "    Single Inheritance:\n",
    "        Single inheritance refers to the inheritance of properties and behaviors from a single base class. In this approach, a derived class can have only one direct superclass or base class.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "            1. Single inheritance is straightforward and easy to understand. It provides a clear hierarchical relationship between classes, making the code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "            2. It helps maintain the integrity and cohesiveness of the codebase.\n",
    "            3. With single inheritance, the complexity of class relationships is minimized since there is only one direct superclass.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "        Multiple inheritance refers to the inheritance of properties and behaviors from multiple base classes.\n",
    "        Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "            1. A derived class can inherit and combine features from multiple base classes, leveraging functionality from different sources 2. without code duplication.\n",
    "            This can provide greater flexibility and expressive power in designing complex systems.\n",

    "Ans. \n",
    "    In inheritance, the \"protected\" access modifier plays a significant role in controlling the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields and methods) within a class hierarchy. The \"protected\" access modifier has distinct characteristics and differs from the \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"public\" Access Modifier:\n",
    "        \"public\" members are accessible from anywhere, both within the class and outside of it. They can be accessed by derived classes, other classes, or any other code that has visibility to the class. \"public\" members have the highest level of accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"protected\" Access Modifier:\n",
    "        The \"protected\" access modifier provides a level of visibility that is between \"private\" and \"public.\" Members marked as \"protected\" are accessible within the same class, derived classes, and even other classes in the same package or assembly (depending on the programming language).\n",
