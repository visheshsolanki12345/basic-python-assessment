=============================== Start Q 1 ======================================
Q.1 Create two int type variables, apply addition, subtraction, division and multiplications
    and store the results in variables. Then print the data in the following format by calling the
    variables:
Ans =>
    a = 10
    b = 2
    print(f"Addition : {a}+{b} = {a+b}")
    print(f"Subtraction : {a}-{b} = {a-b}")
    print(f"Multiplication : {a}*{b} = {a*b}")
    print(f"Division : {a}/{b} = {a/b}")
================================ End Q 1 ========================================


=============================== Start Q 2 ======================================
Q.2 What is the difference between the following operators:
    (i) ‘/’ & ‘//’
    (ii) ‘**’ & ‘^’
Ans =>
    :
================================ End Q 2 ========================================


=============================== Start Q 3 ======================================
Q.3 List the logical operators.
Ans =>
    Python has three Boolean operators, or logical operators: and , or , and not .
================================ End Q 3 ========================================


=============================== Start Q 4 ======================================
Q.4 Explain right shift operator and left shift operator with examples.
Ans =>
    Python right shift operator is exactly the opposite of the left shift operator. Then left side operand bits are moved towards the right side for the given number of times. In simple terms, the right side bits are removed.
================================ End Q 4 ========================================


=============================== Start Q 5 ======================================
Q.5 Create a list containing int type data of length 15. Then write a code to check if 10 is
    present in the list or not.
Ans =>
    list_of_numbers = list(range(1, 16))
    if 10 in list_of_numbers:
        print("Yes 10 is present in list")
    else:
        print("Not 10 is not present in list")
================================ End Q 5 ========================================
